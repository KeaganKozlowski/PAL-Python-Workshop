#Syntax
variable_name = value
#Example 1
x = 10 #Type doesn't have to be defined as python presumes it is an integer
name = "John" #Type doesn't have to be defined as python presumes it is an String
#Example 2 of different naming conventions
first_name = "John" #Snake case preferred in Python
firstName = "John" #Camel case
FirstName = "John" #Pascal case (Upper Camel case)
first-name = "John" #Kebab case (Cannot use in Python hyphens not allowed in variables)
FIRST_NAME = "John" #Uppercase
